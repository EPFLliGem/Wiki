## Notebooks

1. Go to http://2017.igem.org/Team:EPFL/Notebook
2. Go to Wiki tools -> Edit 
3. Place the content in this template
       
       ```html
		<div class="weekly-notebook {x}" id="week{y}">
			<div class="date"> DD/MM/2017 - DD/MM/2017 </div>
			<div class="goal">
				Place the goal of the week here
			</div>
			<div class="summary">
				<ul>
			    <li> First task done</li>
			    <li> Second task done </li>
                <li> Third task done </li>
			   <li> Copy/Remove the <li>...</li> tags if you have more/less tasks to add .... </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
        ```
        - Replace {x} with left if the week is odd or with right if the week is even
        - Replace {y} with the number of week (i.e. 02 for the second week, 10 for the 10th week) 

4. Find the line `<!-- Insert new week before this line -->`
5. Copy/paste the prepared content above the line
6. Save or preview the updated page

N.B: The option to add figures to notebooks will be added in few days.
