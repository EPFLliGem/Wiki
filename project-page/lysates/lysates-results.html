		<p>Having chosen ß-Galactosidase as the main reporter protein, the choice for the lysate that we are using had to be made based on the respective expression of the reporter in each protein.</p>

		<p>BL21 was not a good choice as the fully functioning enzyme was already present in the lysate and an immediate colour change could be observed. The BL21 lysate based on YTPG medium started on a lower expression level than the normal BL21 lysate. This is most probably due to the different pathways of metabolism. In YTPG, the enzyme ß-Galactosidase is not used for the general metabolism, so its expression is much lower in the beginning. </p>
		<p>The expression levels of Top10-GamS lysate are very unexpected and most likely due to overspill or pipetting errors during the preparation of the experiment.</p>
		<p>Both M15-T7 lysates reach a satisfying level of ß-Galactosidase expression that produces a colour change visible for the naked eye. The M15-T7 lysate is thus our lysate of choice.</p>
