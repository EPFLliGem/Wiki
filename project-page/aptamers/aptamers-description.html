			<div class="title animated bounceInDown" > Microfluidics </div>
		<p>Microfluidics is a powerful tool in synthetic biology with a wide range of applications such as aptamers screening. Microfluidics chips consist of micron-sized channels where volumes on the scale of micro-liters flow can interact. </p>
	
		<p>The use of microfluidics has many advantages including high sensitivity, reducing costs and increasing throughput. </p>

		<p>These microfluidics chips are made of polymeric organosilicion compounds such as PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) and contain integrated mechanical systems (sandwiches, necks, buttons, …) allowing a great modularity in experiments. </p>

			<div class="title"> Why microfluidics? </div>
		<p> Since we are working with proteins and aptamers, it was necessary necessary to go to small volumes in order to minimize the cost of our experiments but also to measure with high precision the affinity between the protein and the aptamers.</p>

			<div class="title">How does it work? </div>
		 
		<p> A MITOMI (Mechanically Induced Trapping of Molecular Interactions) 768 chip is a simple double layer microfluidic device composed of inter-connected channels and chambers. One of the layer is the so-called control layer which allows to open or close mechanical systems (buttons, necks, …) by adding extra-pressure with a fluid such as water. Under the control layer, the so-called flow layer is present to flow every compound. Both layers are finally aligned and fixed on an epoxy-coated glass slide as shown in Figure 1.</p>

		<p> Before running an experiment, the Neutravidin surface chemistry is performed as shown in Figure 2. </p>

		<p> Since the last layer of this surface chemistry is Biotin-BSA (BB), the first compound, which is being flown in the various channels, must be biotinylated in order to bind to the surface. At least one compound of the experiment must integrate a fluorophore since the chip is being analyzed under a fluorescent microscope. </p>
