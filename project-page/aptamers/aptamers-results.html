			<div class="title"> Aptamers (G15D and 60-18[29]a) binding test </div>

			<p>We tested the affinity of our Cy3 (G15D) and Cy5 (60-18[29]a) labeled aptamers with biotinylated human thrombin. This experiment was done on a MITOMI 768 chip flowing biotinylated human thrombin and then the two aptamers (in different parts of the chip) in order to see whether they bind with thrombin. The affinity is measured by the relative fluorescence in the different channels (Cy3 and Cy5). As a negative control, both Cy3 and Cy5 primers were flown instead of the aptamer in half of the chip to make sure thrombin doesn’t unspecifically bind DNA oligos.  </p>

			<p>A fluorescent scan of the microfluidic chip resulted in a fluorescent signal in both Cy3 and Cy5 channels (Figure 1 and 2) in the button area for the aptamers and no signal for the control as expected.</p>

	<div class="title"> /5Cy3/-27D-G15D and /5Cy5/60-18[29]a sandwich binding of biotinylated Human a-Thrombin </div>
	<p> The data displayed in Figures 3 and 4, obtained from a MyOne Dynabeads™ T1 Streptavidin magnetic bead pulldown assay[1], where fluorescence was measured every minute for an hour and a half, shows that both aptamers bind thrombin at a concentration of 2.8 nM. However, this seems to drastically approach the inferior limit of detection as, at such a concentration, unspecific binding to the streptavidin beads results in fluorescence levels that are extremely close to those displayed by the samples containing Thrombin. Due to the time necessary to perform washing steps in the pulldown assay, the beads in the sandwich assay spent less time in contact with /5Cy5/60-18[29]a, which could explain the lower RFU. Moreover, due to the regularity of the fluorescence levels, the necessity for long analysis time is negated, which effectively reduces the time for a complete assay.</p>

	  <figcaption>Figure 3: <b> Cy3 filter fluorescence measurement of /5Cy5/60-18[29]a and /5Cy3/-27B-G15D sandwich binding of biotin Human alpha-Thrombin.</b> The Cy3 fluorescence levels were measured using a plate-reader with excitation and emission spectrums set at 549 nm and 571 nm respectively. In the sandwich assay, both aptamers are bound to the thrombin and emit fluorescence. The turquoise asterisks represent the control where a-biotin was flown to saturate streptavidin binding sites on the beads. The blue plus is the no thrombin control, meaning that the fluorescence displayed is due to unspecific binding. Finally, the No Cy5 and No Cy3 controls respectively represent assays where the Cy5 and Cy3 labelled aptamers were not flown.</figcaption>
