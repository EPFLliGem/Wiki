			This week was all about moving into our new lab and getting everything organised!
			</div>
			<div class="summary">
				<ul>
					<li> We started running PCRs to amplify linear DNA templates we needed for our experiments.</li>
					<li> To see whether our lysates are able to express &beta;-Galactosidase, we run plate reader experiment that took a bit longer than anticipated, because the plate reader wasn't working in the beginning.

					<li>We created our own competent cells and transformed them with a vector containing part of the &beta;-Gal gene that can be found on the iGEM plates.</li>
				    <li>Worked on fabrication of MITOMI chips that can be attached to epoxy-coated slides.</li>	
				    <li>Worked on fabrication of 50 epoxy-coated glass slides for our experiments.</li>	
				    <li>Four of the epoxy-coated glass slides were spotted with Cy3/Cy5-labeled diluted aptamers.  </li>	
				    <li>An experiment was carried out using previously fabricated MITOMI chips to determine wheter or not the thrombin aptamers TBA (G15D) and HD22 (60-18[29]a) are able to bind biotinylated-thrombin. As expected, we observe a fluorescent signal from Cy3/Cy5 labeled anti-thrombin aptamers bound to immobilized biotinylated thrombin in the button areas. This experiment was repeated three times and a calibration curve for both Cy3 and Cy5 on the same MITOMI chip was performed.</li>

				This week was all about planning further experiments...
			</div>
			<div class="summary">
				<ul>
			    <li> We started by the fabrication of new MITOMI chips.</li>
			    <li> We planned a competion MITOMI experiment to check whether there is any competition in the binding of the G15D and TBD anti-thrombin aptamers. Sadly, it didn't work the first time in part because we took very small concentrations thus not reaching saturation. </li>
			   <li> Non-biotinylated alpha human thrombin was ordered. </li>
			   <li> We brainstormed on the fabrication of a functional lateral flow immuno assay using two anti-thrombin aptamers. </li>
